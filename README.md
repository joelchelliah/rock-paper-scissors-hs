# Rock, paper, scissors, in Haskell

A text-based implementation of the game [Rock - Paper - Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors)! A work in progress, to increase my knowledge and experience in Haskell.

## Let the games begin!
There are two ways to build and run the game.

##### :small_blue_diamond: With Stack
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joelchelliah/rock-paper-scissors-hs.git rps && cd rps

stack build
stack exec rps
```

##### :small_blue_diamond: Without Stack
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joelchelliah/rock-paper-scissors-hs.git rps && cd rps

./rps
```

## Game modes
