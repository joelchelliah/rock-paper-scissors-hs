# Rock, paper, scissors, in Haskell

A text-based implementation of the game [Rock - Paper - Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors)! Done as an exercise to increase my knowledge and experience in Haskell.

## Let the games begin!
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joelchelliah/rock-paper-scissors-hs.git rps && cd rps

runhaskell rps.hs
```

## Supported game modes
- [Standard RPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors) :new_moon: :page_facing_up: :scissors:
- [Rock - Paper - Scissors - Lizard - Spock](http://bigbangtheory.wikia.com/wiki/Rock_Paper_Scissors_Lizard_Spock) :new_moon: :page_facing_up: :scissors: :dragon: :v:
- [RPS - 7](http://www.umop.com/rps7.htm) :new_moon: :page_facing_up: :scissors: :fire: :bread: :dash: :droplet:
- **Random** :question::grey_question::question::grey_question::question:
